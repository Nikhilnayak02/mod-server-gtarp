Re-Uploading:
You may modify, and use code from this program without my permission. I feel providing source code allows
the modding community to grow.  If you do modify code, please credit me.  Please do not re-upload this yet.
This mod is in an early stage.  It was published early for feedback on its development.  Many updates are to
come so the re-uploaded version will not represent the final form of this mod.  I will change this when I feel
the mod is complete.
